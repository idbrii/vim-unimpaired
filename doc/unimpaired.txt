INTRODUCTION                                    *unimpaired*

This plugin provides several pairs of bracket maps.

NEXT AND PREVIOUS                               *unimpaired-next*

The following maps all correspond to normal mode commands.  If a count is
given, it becomes an argument to the command.  A mnemonic for the "a" commands
is "args" and for the "q" commands is "quickfix".

*[a*     |:previous|
*]a*     |:next|
*[A*     |:first|
*]A*     |:last|
*[b*     |:bprevious|
*]b*     |:bnext|
*[B*     |:bfirst|
*]B*     |:blast|
*[l*     |:lprevious|
*]l*     |:lnext|
*[L*     |:lfirst|
*]L*     |:llast|
*[<C-L>* |:lpfile|
*]<C-L>* |:lnfile|
*[q*     |:cprevious|
*]q*     |:cnext|
*[Q*     |:cfirst|
*]Q*     |:clast|
*[<C-Q>* |:cpfile| (Note that <C-Q> only works in a terminal if you disable
*]<C-Q>* |:cnfile| flow control: stty -ixon)
*[t*     |:tprevious|
*]t*     |:tnext|
*[T*     |:tfirst|
*]T*     |:tlast|
*[<C-T>* |:ptprevious|
*]<C-T>* |:ptnext|

                                                *[f*
[f                      Go to the file preceding the current one
                        alphabetically in the current file's directory.  In
                        the quickfix window, equivalent to |:colder|.

                                                *]f*
]f                      Go to the file succeeding the current one
                        alphabetically in the current file's directory.  In
                        the quickfix window, equivalent to |:cnewer|.

                                                *[n*
[n                      Go to the previous SCM conflict marker or diff/patch
                        hunk.  Try d[n inside a conflict.

                                                *]n*
]n                      Go to the next SCM conflict marker or diff/patch hunk.
                        Try d]n inside a conflict.


PASTING                                         *unimpaired-pasting*

These are experimental:

*>p*    Paste after linewise, increasing indent.
*>P*    Paste before linewise, increasing indent.
*<p*    Paste after linewise, decreasing indent.
*<P*    Paste before linewise, decreasing indent.
*=p*    Paste after linewise, reindenting.
*=P*    Paste before linewise, reindenting.

|]p|, |[p|, |[P|, and |]P| have also been remapped to force linewise pasting,
while preserving their usual indent matching behavior.
